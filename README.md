To build the `moqui-ai` component and integrate a suitable AI tool, here are the steps and AI options you should consider:

### Step 1: Choose a Suitable AI Tool
You need an AI tool that can understand natural language and interact with Moqui ERP, following role-based permissions. Here are some possible options:

#### 1. **OpenAI GPT (ChatGPT API)**
- **Advantages**:
  - Pre-trained on vast amounts of natural language data.
  - Strong ability to handle complex conversations and understand scenarios.
  - Flexible integration through APIs.
  - You can build custom instructions (like role-based access) within your code to filter results based on Moqui's authority system.
  - Can help maintain the ERP system by ingesting new data as required.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Data privacy concerns need to be carefully managed.
  - Relies on external servers (OpenAI's infrastructure).

**How to Integrate**:
- You would make API calls from Moqui to OpenAI’s GPT API. For example, when a WeChat user asks a question, the query is sent to GPT, and GPT provides the answer after filtering based on the user's role and authority rules.

#### 2. **Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (Language Understanding and QnA Maker)**
- **Advantages**:
  - Highly customizable with built-in security and compliance.
  - Can be trained on private data sets and integrated deeply into Moqui's architecture.
  - Supports natural language understanding and can connect with ERP data.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Potentially more configuration is needed to train the system.
  - May require additional services to handle fine-grained role-based filtering.

**How to Integrate**:
- You could use Azure's Language Understanding and QnA Maker to handle natural language queries and filter results based on user roles by connecting to Moqui’s ERP system.

#### 3. **Anthropic Claude or Ollama**
- **Advantages**:
  - Focused on ethical AI and data privacy.
  - Capable of handling natural language queries effectively.
  - Could be useful if you prefer a more privacy-focused, configurable AI system.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Claude and Ollama are newer systems and may require more effort to integrate deeply with your ERP's specific use cases.

**How to Integrate**:
- Like with OpenAI, you would make API calls to Claude or Ollama, filtering responses based on the role-based permissions in Moqui.

### Step 2: Integration with Moqui
You will need to develop the following components within `moqui-ai`:
1. **Request Handlers**: Handle incoming questions from WeChat users and send them to the chosen AI tool.
2. **Response Filtering**: Based on the AI's response, apply Moqui's party authority rules to filter out information that the user is not allowed to see.
3. **Data Ingestion and Maintenance**: Periodically train the AI model with updated ERP data. Ensure that any new data introduced to Moqui is consistent and secure.

### Step 3: Customization for Role-Based Access
- **Party Authority Integration**: You need to ensure that when a user like Tina (the warehouse manager) asks about inventory, the AI should query Moqui’s services and return only data specific to the warehouse she manages. This will require Moqui’s role and permissions system to be integrated with the AI response logic.

### Step 4: Maintenance and Training on Private Data
- **Automated Training**: Ensure that your AI is periodically trained on updated ERP data (e.g., financial data, inventory levels) and that it follows strict privacy rules.
- **Data Update Mechanism**: As the ERP system changes (e.g., new warehouses are added or roles change), ensure these changes are reflected in the AI's training data.

### Recommended Approach
Given your preference for a natural language understanding AI tool:
1. **Start with OpenAI GPT**. It’s easier to integrate and doesn’t require building complex data flows. The role-based filtering and ERP data ingestion can be handled on the Moqui side.
2. **Set up API interactions**: Moqui will handle incoming requests, query GPT, and filter responses based on user permissions. As you scale, you can explore more customizable options like Azure Cognitive Services.

### Step 5: Implementation Plan
1. **API Setup**: Establish an API connection between Moqui and your chosen AI tool.
2. **Role-Based Query Filtering**: Implement logic in Moqui that applies party authority rules to filter AI responses.
3. **Training and Maintenance**: Build a pipeline to periodically train the AI with updated ERP data.
